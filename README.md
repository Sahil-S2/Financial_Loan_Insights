## Project Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of loan data to uncover insights into lending practices and borrower behavior. By examining key metrics such as total applications, funded amounts, and payment records, we categorize loans into good and bad categories and analyze average interest rates across different loan purposes.
Also assess debt-to-income (DTI) ratios on a monthly basis, investigate loan amounts issued by state, and evaluate the average annual income of applicants by home ownership status. Through this analysis, we aim to inform data-driven decision-making in the banking sector and contribute to discussions on responsible lending and financial well-being.

## Objectives

**Analyze Loan Applications:** To explore the total number of loan applications and the total funded amount to assess the lending landscape.

**Evaluate Financial Metrics:** To calculate average interest rates and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, providing insights into borrower financial health.

**Categorize Loan Performance:** To distinguish between good and bad loans, analyzing the implications for lenders and borrowers.

**Examine Geographic Trends:** To investigate loan amounts issued by state and distribution across application types, identifying regional lending patterns.

**Inform Decision-Making:** To utilize findings to support data-driven decisions in the banking sector, fostering responsible lending practices.


## Project Description

This project analyzes a banking dataset to reveal insights into loan trends, borrower behavior, and financial health.
